Package main is the entry point for the `miniproject` brute-force simulator.
It demonstrates initializing the logger and running an attack using the
`attack.Engine` with a configured `attack.AttackConfig`. Run the program with an
argument of `info` or `debug` to set the logging level.

Usage:

    go run . info
    go run . debug
