// Package utils contains helper utilities used by the miniproject example.
//
// It exposes small, focused helpers for logging, hash conversions, mask-based
// password generation, and other runtime utilities that keep the demo code
// readable and reusable. The functions are intentionally simple and documented
// so `godoc` can generate human-readable documentation for the example.
